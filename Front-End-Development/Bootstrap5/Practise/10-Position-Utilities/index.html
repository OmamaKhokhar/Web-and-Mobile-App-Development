    <!-- Position Utilities: It used for utilities for quickly configuring the position of an element.
    
    Position Values: It Quickly positioning classes are available, though they are not responsive.
    .position-static: Default positioning. The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
    .position-relative: The element is positioned relative to its normal position. Offsets can be applied using top, right, bottom, and left properties.
    .position-absolute: The element is positioned absolutely to its nearest positioned ancestor (not static).
    .position-fixed: The element is positioned relative to the viewport, meaning it stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled.
    .position-sticky: The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position. It toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position.

    Arrange Elements: It arrange elements easily with the edge positioning utilities. The format is {property}-{position}.
    Properties:
    top: For the vertical top position.
    start: For the horizontal left position (in LTR).
    bottom: For the vertical bottom position.
    end: For the horizontal right position (in LTR).
    Positions:
    0: For 0 edge position.
    50: For 50% edge position.
    100: For 100% edge position. -->

    <!--Translate: The translate allows you to move an element along the X and Y axes. This movement is relative to the elementâ€™s original position .
    Translate-Middle: The .translate-middle class combines translateX(-50%) and translateY(-50%). This utility centers an element by moving it 50% to the left and 50% up from its current position, typically used with absolute positioning to achieve precise centering.
    Translate-Middle-X: The .translate-middle-x class applies translateX(-50%). This horizontally centers an element by moving it 50% to the left.
    Translate-Middle-Y: The .translate-middle-y class applies translateY(-50%). This vertically centers an element by moving it 50% up from its original position.-->
