// A conditional statement is a programming construct that executes different code blocks based on whether a specified condition is true or false.

// If Statement: A control structure that allows you to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.
// Condition: An expression that evaluates to true or false, determining whether the code block inside the if statement should run.

// >: Checks if the left value is greater than the right.
