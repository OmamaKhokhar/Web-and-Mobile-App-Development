<!-- Chapter 3 : Ordered Lists

Ordered Lists: Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order.

Nested List: You can put a second list inside an <li> element to create a sublist or nested list.
